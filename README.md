The pbash system is limited to only commands. No logic, but you can write a file call boot.pbash in the / directory to make that script run on boot.  
It also comes with tabbing functionality  
This was just supposed to be a fun project for me to test out io on the keyboard but it became much more than that.  
  
Thank you!
